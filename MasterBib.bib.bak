  abstract = {The energy to desorb atomic oxygen from an interstellar dust grain
	surface, E des , is an important controlling parameter in gas-grain
	models; its value impacts the temperature range over which oxygen
	resides on a dust grain. However, no prior measurement has been done
	of the desorption energy. We report the first direct measurement
	of E des for atomic oxygen from dust grain analogs. The values of
	E des are 1660 Â± 60 and 1850 Â± 90 K for porous amorphous water
	ice and for a bare amorphous silicate film, respectively, or about
	twice the value previously adopted in simulations of the chemical
	evolution of a cloud. We use the new values to study oxygen chemistry
	as a function of depth in a molecular cloud. For n = 10 4 cm âˆ’3
	and G 0 = 10 2 ( G 0 = 1 is the average local interstellar radiation
	field), the main result of the adoption of the higher oxygen binding
	energy is that H 2 O can form on grains at lower visual extinction
	A V , closer to the cloud surface. A higher binding energy of O results
	in more formation of OH and H 2 O on grains, which are subsequently
	desorbed by far-ultraviolet radiation, with consequences for gas-phase
	chemistry. For higher values of n and G 0 , the higher binding energy
	can lead to a large increase in the column of H 2 O but a decrease
	in the column of O 2 .},
